# ts-node-express-cassandra
A playground project for exploring the integration of typescript, node, express, cassandra and docker for development and production

# Getting started

- Clone this project
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Navigate to project directory and run `docker-compose up`. This will:
  - build the server's docker image
  - spin up a 2 node Cassandra cluster
  - start the server in development mode
- Test APIs against http://localhost:3000
  
**Notes:** While Docker Compose spins up the Cassandra cluster the server will wait 30 seconds before it starts the first time. In development mode, the server will automatically reload when it detects changes in the src folder.
